Objective:
  Guess your opponent's Mystery Person by asking yes/no questions to eliminate faces on your gameboard.

  How to Play:
    Your Turn:
      Ask one yes/no question about the Mystery Person (e.g., "Does your person have glasses?"). Eliminate faces based on the answer.

  Guessing:
      On your turn, you can choose to guess the Mystery Person instead of asking a question. If your guess is correct, you win! If it's wrong, you lose.

  Winning the Game: 
      Players take turns until one correctly guesses the opponent's Mystery Person or the opponent guesses incorrectly.
